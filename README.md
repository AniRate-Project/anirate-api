# AniRate API

This API is currently in development. See the ["Contributing"](#contributing) section below to know more about how to help.

## Brief summary

The AniRate REST API is intended both for the Discord bot and for public sources (such as websites) related to it.

It is currently written in TypeScript, and we chose MongoDB as our go-to database engine, along with Redis caching.
We currently are using Express, Overnightjs, Mongoose and other open-source libraries.
We're trying to follow the REST principles, and chose a simple monolith architecture.

The API is currently hosted on Heroku (hence the Procfile), and makes use of MongoDB Atlas and Redislabs.
